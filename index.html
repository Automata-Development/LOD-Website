						<h3>Our Beliefs</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Jesus Christ is the Son of God.</li>
							<li>Jesus lived on the earth, died on the cross, and was raised from the dead.</li>
							<li>Everyone is born with a sin disease and is separated from God; that separation can only be cured by trusting your life to Jesus.</li>
							<li>The Bible is the Word of God.</li>
							<li>Worship is our expression of love to God.</li>
							<li>The Church is all people who have trusted their lives to Christ; it is God's plan for reaching the world with the Good News of Jesus.</li>
							<li>Sacraments, Baptism and Holy Communion, are God's gifts to us. We understand a sacrament to be something that Christ Himself commanded us to do; it involves an earthly element (water, bread, wine), and is a promise by God and a celebration of forgiveness
								and new life.</li>
							<li>Jesus Christ will one day return to judge the living and the dead.</li>
							<li>Followers of Jesus are called to grow in a personal relationship with Jesus, to do what Jesus tells us to do, to allow God's Word to change us to be more like Jesus, and to share the love of Jesus with others.</li>

						<h3>LCMC Statement of Faith</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>We believe, teach, and confess the Triune God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</li>
							<li>We believe, teach, and confess Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior and the gospel as the power of God for the salvation of all who believe in him. Jesus Christ is the Word of God incarnate, through whom everything was made and through whose life, death,
								and resurrection God fashions a new creation. The proclamation of God’s message to us as both law and gospel is the Word of God, revealing judgment and mercy in the person and work of Jesus Christ through whom God was pleased to reconcile all
								things to himself.</li>
							<li>The canonical Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments are the Word of God. Inspired by God’s Spirit speaking through their authors, they record and announce God’s revelation centering in Jesus Christ. Through them God’s Spirit speaks to us to
								create and sustain Christian faith and fellowship for service in the world.</li>
							<li>We believe, teach, and accept the canonical Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments as the inspired Word of God and the sole authoritative source and norm of our proclamation, faith, and life.</li>
							<li>We accept the Apostles’, Nicene, and Athanasian Creeds as true declarations of the scriptural faith we believe, teach, and confess.</li>
							<li>We believe, teach, and accept the Unaltered Augsburg Confession and the Small Catechism as true witnesses to the Word of God, normative for our teaching and practice. We acknowledge that we are one in faith and doctrine with all churches that likewise
								accept the teachings of the Unaltered Augsburg Confession.</li>
							<li>We believe, teach, and confess the other confessional writings in the Book of Concord, namely, the Apology of the Augsburg Confession, the Smalcald Articles, the Treatise, the Large Catechism, and the Formula of Concord, as further valid expositions
								of the Holy Scriptures.</li>
							<li>We believe, teach, and confess the gospel, recorded in the Holy Scriptures and confessed in the ecumenical creeds and Lutheran confessional writings, as the power of God to create and sustain the priesthood of all believers for God’s mission in
								the world.</li>

						<h3>Bio</h3>
						<p>Hello, I am Tamra Duncan, the Director of Music Ministries at Light of the Desert Lutheran Church. I began my ministry here in 2007 but have been involved in church music ministry for the majority of my life.</p>
						<p>My roots are based out of Wisconsin. I grew up on a small farm in Pewaukee Wisconsin. My parents were not musical at all but they scraped enough money together to bless my brothers and I with piano lessons. I loved playing the piano and my brothers,
							well... not so much. I continued taking lessons and decided with the help of my high school choir teacher to pursue music in college. I moved to Florida and majored in piano performance then took a hiatus and eventually graduated from Grand Canyon
							University with my bachelors in music (emphasis in choral studies and voice) and went on to a master’s degree in music education through ASU. I have been teaching music in the Paradise Valley School district for 15 years. I currently teach choir
							and piano at Paradise Valley High School.</p>
						<p>When I’m not working I love spending time with my husband Jeff and my two dogs. I have 2 grown daughters, Tonya and Kia who fill me with joy and make me so proud. Hiking, biking, working out, reading and traveling are some of my favorite things
							to do. God has blessed me greatly in doing what I love as a career with people that share the same passion. God is good, All the time.</p>

						<p>My life verse is Jeremiah 29:11 “For I know the plans that I have for you,” declares the LORD, “plans for welfare and not for calamity to give you a future and a hope.” This verse has certainly held true at many times in my life but especially as
							the Lord led me to worship at Light of the Desert. Thirty years of service in the corporate world was enough for me and God called me to “trust” him for my future – and to devote more of my time to his work. I have served him here at LOD as a volunteer:
							teaching, leading small groups, and as the Director of Adult Ministries; when the opportunity came to work alongside the staff as Administrative Assistant to the Pastor – that was just icing on the cake. Every day I look forward to seeing what
							“new plan” God has for me and I am blessed to be a part of this church family.</p>

						<p>My wife Laura and I first visited Light of the Desert in the summer of 2003 with our children Grace and Sam for Vacation Bible School. We were blessed and drawn by the warm reception of the Light of the Desert Family and within the year we joined
							the church as members. In September of 2004 our family was blessed with the addition of our daughter Caroline and she was baptized at LOD a short time later. I volunteered intermittently with several ministries at LOD including serving on the church
							council. After serving on the council I answered the call to teach Sunday School to the 3rd – 5th Graders at LOD. This became a real blessing and source of joy for me. I was blessed with more free time and began teaching more frequently until it
							became a regular thing. I feel very called and excited about serving as Director of Children’s Ministries.</p>
						<p>Outside of the church I was in the hospitality business for 30 years with 25 of those years as an aspiring cook and finally an Executive Chef. The last five years of my career in the hospitality business were as a Clubhouse Manager for a private
							golf club in Scottsdale, AZ. I am currently a Realtor with Russ Lyon Sotheby’s International Realty and enjoying much more free time with my awesome wife Laura and our wonderful children.</p>
						<p>My Life Verse is Jeremiah 29:11</p>
						<p>For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the LORD, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.</p>

						<h3>Kate Gotschall</h3>
						<p>Co-Director of Children's Ministries</p>
						<br class="clearBoth" />
						<h3>Bio</h3>
						<p>Hello!  I am Kate Gotschall and I am the Co-director of Children's Ministry at Light of the Desert since October of 2018</p>
						<p>My husband, Matt and I along with our two girls, Lauren and Emily relocated to the Valley of The Sun in March of 2016 from Ankeny, Iowa.  When we first landed in Cave Creek, we visited a few different churches and always came back to Light of the Desert
							because it felt like home!  Teaching is a true passion of mine.  I graduated from Creighton University with a Bachelor of Science in Elementary Education.  I taught 3 years in Des Moines at Christ the King Elementary and then made the move to corporate
							life, working at Nationwide Insurance.  When I came on board at Nationwide, I thought I would become a corporate trainer and ended up in the project world, which I absolutely love!  Since my oldest was 2 years old, I have taught Sunday School in one
							capacity or another and upon joining Light of the Desert I started to volunteer as a teacher. I was absolutely thrilled when asked to join the staff and work alongside my amazing peers, helping to share God's light and Word with others! </p>
						<p>In my spare time, I enjoy spending time with my family exploring all this beautiful state offers!  I love to cook, bake, hike and enjoy the pool!  I am thrilled to be driving distance to the ocean as well as the northern pines!  One of my favorite Bible
							verses is John 13:34, “And now I give you a new commandment: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another. </p>

						<p>Hi, my name is Sarah! I am the Director of Worship Ministries at Light of the Desert, which includes helping to design our worship services so that people are able to focus on Jesus and praise Him through music. I am grateful for this opportunity to serve!</p>
						<p>Light of the Desert has been my church home since 1995 and I am grateful for my second family here. I attended Grand Canyon University for my undergraduate degree (Lopes UP!) and am currently a student at Fuller Seminary pursuing a Master's in Theology.
							In my spare time, I love spending time with my friends and family, playing the piano, and taking every opportunity to be outside...especially to hike.</p>
						<p>I cannot wait to see how God continues to use those at Light of the Desert to accomplish His great plan in Cave Creek and the rest of the world. He is so faithful! One of my favorite Bible verses is Philippians 4:13, "I can do all things through Him who strengthens me."</p>

					<h3>What to Expect</h3>
					<p>
						From the fall to the spring, we offer two services, which are identical to each other. We’re a pretty relaxed bunch here and our congregation bridges many generations so there is a place for you here. We offer a blended style of music, from traditional
						hymns to the current Christian contemporary music. After the music is finished, there will be a sermon focused on Scripture that challenges and encourages. We offer communion on the first and third Sunday’s of each month. No dress code required
						here, come as you are. Most people you’ll find here on a Sunday morning are in jeans and polo or button down or supporting their favorite sports team of the season. After our services you will find many of us hanging out in the lobby, enjoying donuts,
						lemonade, and coffee each Sunday. We hope to see you here soon!

					<h3>College Ministry</h3>

					<p>Each year Light of the Desert sends care packages to our college students. All we ask is for the family to provide the address and a list of some of their favorite snacks that we can throw in the box. During the summer we offer occasional outings
						for our college students for them to connect and grow in their faith.</p>

					<h3>Our House</h3>
					<hr/>
					<p>
						Our House is a ministry of Light of the Desert Lutheran Church in Cave Creek, AZ. We invite any family with kids to come and join us on Wednesday nights during the month of June for food, fun, and some learning about our faith. Most nights at Our House will
						look like this:
					</p>
					<p>5:45 - 6:30 pm - Dinner! (show up any time and get fed)</p>
					<p>6:30 - 7:45 pm - Children and Adults head to their respective areas for intentional time.</p>
					<p>
						Our children’s time will focus on learning about Jesus, singing songs, making crafts, and playing games. Adults will be given space to relax for a bit, invited to discuss the topic of the evening, and be encouraged to explore their faith.
